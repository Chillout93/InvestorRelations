<h2 id="corporate_social_responsibility">Corporate Social Responsibility</h2>
<p>Our approach to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is based on a simple principle: that Mulberry will make a positive difference to its people, 
the environment and the communities in which it works. We actively encourage our employees to find new ways of meeting our wider responsibilities, and 
as a company have focused our initiatives in six key areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Climate change</li>
  <li>Reducing waste</li>
  <li>Fair partners</li>
  <li>Animal welfare</li>
  <li>Community involvement</li>
  <li>Health and wellbeing</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3>Governance</h3>
<p>Our CSR strategy is agreed at the highest level in the company. The CSR team coordinates strategic work streams in collaboration with relevant departments and 
reports regularly to the Management Board.</p>

<h3>People & Fair Partners</h3>
<h4 class="headertop">Apprentices</h4>
<p>In 2006 we took on our first apprentices through a new Government approved scheme supported by Skillset UK and Bridgwater College. The year-long training course, 
comprising a leather skills NVQ and technical certificate, sets young apprentices on the path to becoming accomplished craftsmen and craftswomen. 
In the nine years since we started, more than 80 apprentices have completed the course. Some of these apprentices have gone on to apply their skills 
and knowledge to different roles in the company for example product development, planning and market support.</p>

<p>As a result of the success of the programme, we have a waiting list of young people aspiring to join our production line team.</p>

<p>The programme has also received national recognition. In February 2010, we were proud to receive the National Skills Award, given to acknowledge 
excellence and world class performance in manufacturing. In 2014 we received the Business in the Community Big Tick Award in the Inspiring Young Talent category.</p>

<h4>Manufacturing</h4>
<p>We are proud to produce over 50% of our leather goods in our British factories, The Rookery and The Willows. Mulberry is the largest manufacturer of luxury goods in the
UK and employs over 550 people between the two factories.</p>

<p>We also work with a select group of suppliers elsewhere in the UK and overseas. We expect these suppliers to create a suitable environment for 
their workers, and ask them to adhere to a set of standards called the Mulberry Global Sourcing Principles. We are committed to enforcing these 
standards though regular inspections of supplier facilities by our own employees and by third-party auditors.</p>

</p>

<h4>Environment</h4>
<h5 class="headertop">Sustainable buildings</h5>
<p>Investing in the latest technologies, along with awareness raising activities among employees, are just two methods we are using to help 
reduce our energy consumption. Both of our UK factories have rainwater harvesting for grey water use, and we have solar thermal panels to 
heat the water at our Chilcompton factory. At our Bridgwater factory, the Willows, the installation of 290m² solar panels will generate power 
for approximately 10% of the site’s energy needs.</p>

<p>Mulberry worked with specialist energy auditors to carry out for site energy audits in 2014/15 across our office, factory, 
warehouse and retail sites to comply with the government's Energy Saving Opportunities Scheme. The report found that 'a significant 
amount of work has already been completed to improve efficiency' but that across the estate 'lighting, heating and cooling are significant 
energy users and should be examined closely for energy saving opportunities.' A number of energy saving measures were identified, with 
opportunities for Mulberry to save over 10% of our total energy spend.</p>

<h5>Animal Welfare & Biodiversity</h5>
<p>We are committed to ethical practices in the catching, maintaining, breeding, raising, transportation, handling, and slaughter of animals in our leather, 
fur and exotic skins supply chains.</p>

<p>We are committed to sustaining well-functioning and bio-diverse ecosystems in the regions where we source. This includes maintaining species populations of wild
animals at sustainable levels as well as to only source material of animal origin from legal sources.</p>

<p>We collect traceability information on all our leather articles, so we know if we can trace it to the farm, to the abattoir or to the country of 
origin. Traceability is the tool by which we can understand the wider environmental and social impacts in our leather supply chain, including animal 
welfare, land use impacts and how the leather was made.</p>

<p>Since 2014 Mulberry has made annual disclosures to the CDP Forests Program on our forest-risk commodity purchasing practices.</p>

<p>We carry out research on welfare issues on the various materials we source, and the regions where we source from, also collaborating on 
research with the Sustainable Luxury Working Group, a group of companies that produce luxury goods and that share a commitment to advancing good 
social, environmental and animal welfare practices in their operations.</p>

<h4>Recycling</h4>
<p>We recycle as much material as possible from our UK sites. We have set up a number of partnerships with scrap stores local to our Somerset factories, 
passing on a significant quantity of our leather off-cuts to community arts and crafts groups. We are actively seeking other upcycling and recycling 
opportunities for our leather offcuts.</p>

<h4>Community Involvement</h4>
<h5 class="headertop">Charity</h5>
<p>Mulberry actively donates money, product and support to charities in our local community and across the wider industry. In addition each year 
our employees select 3 charities to offer additional support through matching employee fundraising and raising employee awareness for these 
charities and their causes. Our 2015/16 charities are:</p>

<h5>Teenage Cancer Trust</h5>
<p>A national charity which funds teenage cancer units in hospitals, and provides support to young people in the UK who have been diagnosed with cancer.</p>

<h5>Jessie May</h5>
<p>A South West based charity who provide free of charge home care to children with life-limiting conditions, ensuring they get the best quality of life 
possible and supporting their families throughout.</p>

<h5>Thames Reach</h5>
<p>A London based charity helping homeless and vulnerable people to find homes, build supportive relationships and lead fulfilling lives.</p>

<h4>California Transparency in Supply Chains Act</h4>
<p>Under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, companies of a certain size doing business in the State of California are 
obliged to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct product supply chains for the goods that they offer for sale.</p>

<p>All of Mulberry’s supplier relationships are governed by Mulberry’s Global Sourcing Principles which includes the absolute prohibition of forced or bonded labour. 
In this disclosure we explain in more detail how we apply this policy in practice through good governance practices.</p>
